# Things to do
- [x] Get nearby connection transport to properly start on initial install.
- [x] Sync entire chat history instead of just the new history.
- [x] Chat users should be added as soon as they are discovered instead of waiting for the next timer.
- Update chat users that are coming back online, as online.
  - [x] Implement a clock store so we don't break syncing.
- [x] Reduce the amount of time between discovery and addition.
- [ ] Support peers with different transport protocols.
- [ ] Support syncing certain events to only certain peers.
- [x] Implement a mechanism for handling disconnections and reconnections gracefully.
- [x] Implement a mechanism for handling network errors and retries.
- [ ] Implement a mechanism for authentication and authorization.
- [x] Refine the gossip library interface; keep it simple and efficient.
- [ ] Create Kotlin version of gossip library.
- [ ] Create gossip-flutter library for flutter utilities.
- [ ] Create a gossip-nearby library for quick nearby connections support.
- [x] Make sure typed events are optional for all gossip libraries. (all libraries for that matter)
- [ ] Turn typed events into proper Hive objects for faster storage performance.
- [ ] Fix some events missing after peer restart.
- [ ] Fix issue with peers randomly disconnecting without notification.
- [ ] Fix peer list not being updated correctly on a peer that was resarted.
- [ ] Do not display self in peer list.
- [ ] Document that you shouldn't use the actual user id as the peer node id. Use a unique identifier generated on the device instead. The persistent user id should be sent as part of the event data instead. Otherwise you will break causality when using multiple devices with the same user id, or when deleting app data on a peer and re-connecting.
- [ ] Persist the node id with vector clocks to ensure causality is not accidentally broken by failing to store the node id with the clock vector.
