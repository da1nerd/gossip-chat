# Gossip Chat Demo

A fully functional Flutter peer-to-peer chat application that enables real-time messaging between nearby Android devices using Google's Nearby Connections API. No internet connection required!

## ✨ Features

- **🔌 Offline P2P Messaging** - Chat with nearby devices without internet
- **🔍 Automatic Device Discovery** - Finds and connects to nearby devices automatically
- **⚡ Real-time Synchronization** - Messages appear instantly on all connected devices
- **🎨 Modern UI** - Clean Material Design 3 interface with message bubbles
- **👥 Peer Management** - View all connected users in an elegant sidebar
- **🔔 System Notifications** - Join/leave notifications with user-friendly messages
- **🛡️ Smart Permission Handling** - Intelligent permission requests based on Android version
- **🔄 Auto-reconnection** - Handles network disruptions gracefully

## 📱 Requirements

- **Android device** (API level 23 or higher)
- **Bluetooth enabled** for device discovery
- **Location services enabled** (required by Nearby Connections API)
- **Physical proximity** to other devices (typically 100m range)
- **Multiple devices** for testing P2P functionality

## 🔐 Permissions

The app intelligently requests permissions based on your Android version:

### Required Permissions:
- **Location** (ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION) - Required by Nearby Connections API
- **Bluetooth** permissions:
  - Android 11 and below: `BLUETOOTH`
  - Android 12+: `BLUETOOTH_ADVERTISE`, `BLUETOOTH_CONNECT`, `BLUETOOTH_SCAN`

### Optional Permissions:
- **Nearby WiFi Devices** (Android 13+) - For enhanced connectivity
- **Storage** - For potential future file sharing features

The app includes smart permission handling that:
- ✅ Detects your Android version automatically
- ✅ Requests only necessary permissions
- ✅ Provides helpful error messages
- ✅ Guides users through permission setup

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK installed and configured
- Android SDK with API level 23+
- Physical Android devices for testing (emulators won't work for P2P)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd gossip-demo
```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies:**
```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. **Build the APK:**
```bash
flutter build apk --release
```

4. **Install on multiple Android devices:**
```bash
flutter install
# Or manually install the APK from build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/
```

## 📖 How to Use

### First Launch
1. **Open the app** on each Android device
2. **Enter your display name** when prompted
3. **Grant permissions** when requested:
   - Allow Location access
   - Allow Bluetooth permissions
   - Enable Location services if prompted

### Start Chatting
1. **Wait for discovery** - Devices will automatically find each other (usually within 10-30 seconds)
2. **Check connected peers** - Tap the people icon to see connected devices
3. **Start messaging** - Type and send messages that appear on all devices instantly
4. **Watch for notifications** - See when users join or leave the chat

### Troubleshooting
- **No devices found?** Ensure Bluetooth and Location are enabled on both devices
- **Permission errors?** Go to Settings > Apps > Gossip Chat Demo > Permissions
- **Connection issues?** Try moving devices closer together (within 10-20 meters)

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Network Architecture
- **🔗 Direct P2P Mesh Network** - Each device connects directly to every other device
- **📡 Nearby Connections API** - Google's robust P2P networking framework
- **📨 Broadcast Protocol** - Messages sent to all connected peers simultaneously
- **🔄 Auto-discovery** - Continuous scanning for nearby devices
- **🛡️ Connection Management** - Automatic handling of joins, leaves, and failures

### App Architecture
- **🎯 Provider Pattern** - Reactive state management with Flutter Provider
- **📦 Service Layer** - Separated business logic (ChatService, PermissionsService)
- **🎨 Widget Composition** - Reusable UI components (MessageBubble, PeerListDrawer)
- **📱 Material Design 3** - Modern Android design patterns

### Message Protocol
All messages use JSON format over Nearby Connections:

```json
{
  "type": "chat_message",
  "data": {
    "id": "unique-message-id",
    "senderId": "user-id",
    "senderName": "Display Name",
    "content": "Hello world!",
    "timestamp": 1640995200000,
    "type": "text"
  }
}
```

### Message Types
- **`chat_message`** - User text messages with full metadata
- **`user_joined`** - System notification when a user joins the network
- **`user_left`** - System notification when a user leaves the network

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Technologies
- **Flutter SDK** - Cross-platform UI framework
- **nearby_connections** - Official Google plugin for P2P networking
- **Provider** - State management for reactive UI updates
- **SharedPreferences** - Local storage for user identity
- **Material Design 3** - Modern Android UI components

### Key Features Implementation
- **🔍 Automatic Discovery** - Continuous advertising and scanning
- **📡 Multi-peer Support** - Simultaneous connections to multiple devices  
- **💾 Message Deduplication** - Prevents duplicate messages across the network
- **⏰ Smart Timestamps** - Context-aware time formatting (today, yesterday, etc.)
- **🎨 User Avatars** - Generated from names with consistent color coding
- **🔄 Connection Recovery** - Automatic reconnection handling

## ⚠️ Limitations & Considerations

### Platform Limitations
- **Android Only** - Nearby Connections API is Android-exclusive
- **Physical Devices Required** - Cannot test on emulators
- **Range Dependent** - Typically 100m line-of-sight (varies by environment)

### Current Implementation
- **Session-based** - Messages don't persist after app closure
- **Plain Text** - No encryption (fine for demo/local use)
- **No Media** - Text messages only (extensible architecture for future media support)
- **Local Network** - No internet relay or cloud backup

## 🛠️ Development & Testing

### Development Mode
```bash
# Run in development with hot reload
flutter run

# Run with verbose logging for debugging
flutter run --verbose

# Build and test release version
flutter build apk --release
```

### Testing P2P Functionality
Since this is a peer-to-peer app, you need **multiple physical Android devices** to test properly:

1. **Install on Device 1:**
   ```bash
   flutter install
   ```

2. **Install on Device 2 (and 3, 4, etc.):**
   - Copy APK from `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk`
   - Install manually or use `adb install app-release.apk`

3. **Testing Steps:**
   - Open app on all devices
   - Enter different names on each device  
   - Wait for automatic discovery (10-30 seconds)
   - Check peer list to confirm connections
   - Send messages from each device to test sync

### Debugging Tips
```bash
# View logs from connected device
adb logcat | grep -i flutter

# Check if Nearby Connections is working
adb logcat | grep -i nearby

# Monitor permission requests
adb logcat | grep -i permission
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting Guide

### Connection Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 🔍 **No devices found** | • Ensure Bluetooth + Location enabled on both devices<br>• Move devices closer (within 20m)<br>• Restart app and wait 30 seconds |
| 🚫 **Permission denied** | • Open Settings > Apps > Gossip Chat Demo > Permissions<br>• Enable Location, Bluetooth, Nearby devices<br>• Restart app after granting permissions |
| 💔 **Frequent disconnections** | • Keep devices closer together<br>• Ensure Location/GPS is enabled<br>• Check for interference (move away from WiFi routers) |
| 📱 **App crashes on startup** | • Check Android version (need API 23+)<br>• Clear app data and try again<br>• Check device compatibility |

### Message Issues
| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 📤 **Messages not sending** | • Check peer list - are devices connected?<br>• Try sending from other device first<br>• Restart both apps |
| 👥 **Peer list empty** | • Wait 30+ seconds for discovery<br>• Toggle Bluetooth off/on<br>• Move devices closer together |
| 🔄 **Messages appear twice** | • Normal behavior - each device shows its own messages<br>• Check sender name to distinguish sources |
